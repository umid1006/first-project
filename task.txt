The US Dollar (USD) is having a tough time staying resilient against its rivals on the last trading day of the week, with the USD Index staying near the multi-week low it set at around 104.00 earlier in the week. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the jobs report for May later in the day, which will feature Nonfarm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate and wage inflation figures.
